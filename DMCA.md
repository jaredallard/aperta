# DMCA Notice & Takedowns

Someone uploaded something you don't like and you own the copyright for it, and can reasonably prove it?

Cool. Here's what you can do.

## Step 1

Prepare a [DMCA Takedown Notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Notice_from_copyright_owner)

Then email it to the designated agent:

Jared Allard, CEO & Legal Director &lt;jaredallard@outlook.com&gt;

If you wish to physically send a letter, please request their address from an email. If you cannot do so, you may want to rethink
your copyright claim.

## Step 2

Wait for a response from designated agent.

## Step 3

Recieve notice of removal of metadata, or notice of why it wasn't removed.

### If you recieved a notice that you did not provide proper evidence of copyright ownership

Then a reason will be given, and you may re-ubmit your claim and/or contest it.

### If you filed your notice incorrectly, or failed to show reasonable ownership of content

Then you will be sued for wasting our time, and we will seek damages of upwards of $20,000.

## Step 4

Content will be removed, offender will be attempted to be contacted in order to ask for a counter response.

### If they counter respond

You are now able to file a lawsuit against the individual. You have 10-14 days to file a suit. If you do not, the material
may be republished.
